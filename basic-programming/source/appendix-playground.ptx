  <introduction>
    <p>
      This appendix provides you with some code cells of different programming languages, made possible by <pretext />. By playing around with them, you can have a better understanding of the idea that <em>though their syntax might be slightly, or hugely, dissimilar, the fundamental concepts are always there</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      A good way to do so is by looking up code examples. For instance, you can search for <q>javascript code examples</q> on Google.
    </p>
  </introduction>

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-python-play">
    <title>Python</title>

    <sage language="python">
      <input>
        # This is a Python cell
        # Write and run your Python code here

        print("Hello world!")
      </input>
    </sage>

    <p>
      Below is a more complex Python environment, allowing you to work on code through repeated edit-compile-test cycles. There is also a <q>CodeLens</q> button, which activates a steppable program similar to a debugger, meaning you can watch output, variables, and other data change line by line (or statement by statement).
    </p>

    <program language="python" interactive="activecode">
      <input>
        # This is a Python cell
        # Write and run your Python code here

        print("Hello world!")
      </input>
    </program>
    
  </subsection>

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-javascript-play">
    <title>Javascript</title>

    <program language="javascript" interactive="activecode">
      <input>
        // This is a Javascript cell
        // Write and run your Javascript code here

        alert("Hello world!");
      </input>
    </program>

    <p>
      Outputs of Javascript code might not appear right below. To see them, open the <q>Element Inspect</q> panel by right-clicking on the page and select <q>Inspect</q>. Then, go to the <q>Console</q> tab. Run the code and you should see the outputs appear there.
    </p>

        # Write and run your Sage code here

        show("Hello world!")
